======================

A moodle 2 diploma plugin, best features of certificate and simple certificate plugins.

This is another certificate plugin for Moodle 2 platform, that gathers best funcionalities from certificate and simple certificate plugins.

From certificate plugin we get:
- Certificate configuration with added features. Now we can: set 3 logos (top-left, top-center, top-right), set 3 signatures images with name and job position (bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right), expedition event type (course attendance, course passing).
- Simple certificate teacher administration features. Generate diploma tests before creating them, generate and send individual diplomas to selected users, generate a zip files with generated certificates.
- UUID assign to every generated certificate, with a url for certificate validation, and url for extra download when the student has no access to the course.
- Course history tracking for student and teachers even when the course is finished/deleted. (This depends on the diploma_history block just to access the pages through the block). Teachers can check the course history of his students and their associated certificates, students can check their course trackings and associated certificates.
